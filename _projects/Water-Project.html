<p>
For this project, I was tasked with creating a low-cost, sustainable way to purify contaminated water. I started by brainstorming ideas like a tea bag-style filter and a bottle-based gravity filter. Both sounded promising at first, but each had major issues. The tea bag filter created too much waste and required extra chemicals to work. The bottle filter had risks of bacterial growth and wasn’t very reusable.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I came up with a chemical packet design. The packet could be added directly to water and used a blend of safe compounds to clean it without leaving behind any waste. I researched the chemical reactions needed to remove contaminants like iron, lead, and bacteria. Getting the balance right took a few rounds of testing, especially since I didn’t have access to every chemical I originally wanted. But after refining the formula, I created a version that worked effectively and stayed affordable.
</p>

<h3>Design and Build Process</h3>

<p>
I used a mix of aluminum sulfate for coagulation, calcium hydroxide to reduce hardness, sodium bicarbonate to adjust pH, and iodine for disinfection. Each compound played a specific role, and I made sure the ratios stayed safe for consumption. One of the biggest breakthroughs came from understanding how the chemicals interacted and adjusting based on the test results I gathered from simulated dirty water.
</p>

<p>
To test the packet, I created water samples that mimicked conditions like those during the Flint, Michigan crisis. The first sample was untreated. The second showed the result after adding half the packet. The third was the final, purified version. I used turbidity, pH, iron, and lead testing strips to measure the improvements. With each step, I refined the chemistry and adjusted the packet contents.
</p>

<p>
I also created a presentation to explain the design and walk through the science behind the reactions. I didn’t just want the packet to work—I wanted to make it easy to understand and use. The design can scale up or down depending on the amount of water being purified, and it stays effective without needing filters or replacement parts.
</p>

<h3>Engineering Concepts and Lessons</h3>

<p>
This project helped me explore real-world chemistry applications. I had to think about not only what each chemical did on its own, but how they would interact in water. It taught me how to connect theory with experimentation and how to troubleshoot problems when a result wasn’t what I expected.
</p>

<p>
I also realized how important it is to design for people. I focused on making something that was portable, easy to use, and reusable. That focus made the packet useful in situations like natural disasters, backpacking, or low-resource communities where clean water is hard to access.
</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
I learned how to apply chemical concepts in a practical way and how to design a solution that solves a real problem. This project helped me think more like a scientist and a builder at the same time.
