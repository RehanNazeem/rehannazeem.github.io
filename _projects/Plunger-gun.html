<h3>Design and Build Process</h3>

<p>
For my AP Physics final, I worked with a team to recreate the iconic plunger launcher from Fortnite, turning it into a real-world pneumatic device. We weren’t just interested in making something that looked the part — we wanted it to function based on actual physics. That meant building a pressurized air system that could launch a plunger with power, safety, and precision.
</p>

<p>
We used durable PVC piping to create the chamber and barrel, customizing the length and diameter to balance air volume and output force. The pressure chamber was sealed and fitted with a valve to trap compressed air. To build up pressure, we used a standard bike pump, allowing us to manually increase the PSI within the chamber. A pressure gauge helped monitor how much air was stored to ensure safety and repeatability.
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the system was an electronically controlled solenoid valve. When triggered, it opened in a fraction of a second, releasing the compressed air in one clean burst. This sudden release pushed the plunger down the barrel with enough force to replicate the satisfying launch feel from the game. The valve was wired to a simple switch circuit powered by a battery pack housed inside the launcher frame.
</p>

<p>
We 3D printed a mounting bracket for the valve and switch assembly to fit snugly around the PVC tubing. The barrel and body were sanded and glued for a tight seal, and we added end caps with silicone gaskets to make sure no pressure escaped during buildup. We even reinforced the chamber using epoxy to prevent cracking under high loads.
</p>

<h3>Understanding the Pneumatics</h3>

<p>
This launcher relied entirely on compressed air to function. The pressure stored in the chamber built potential energy, which was instantly converted into kinetic energy when the valve opened. We carefully controlled the PSI and volume of air to balance range, accuracy, and safety. Too little air and the plunger would barely move — too much and we risked damaging the hardware. 
</p>

<p>
The moment the valve opened, the pressure differential forced air from the high-pressure chamber into the low-pressure barrel, rapidly accelerating the plunger forward. We used a lightweight foam plunger to keep the mass low, which helped increase the launch speed without overloading the system. The timing of the valve release, tightness of the barrel fit, and air volume all worked together to deliver consistent performance.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
This was one of the most exciting builds I’ve worked on. It brought together hands-on fabrication, electronics, pressure mechanics, and physics concepts I had only seen on paper before. Recreating something from a video game in a real, functioning form made the project feel both creative and technical. I learned a lot about pneumatics and how to convert stored energy into controlled motion, and it was incredibly satisfying to see the launcher actually fire.
