<p>
 I created a vehicle that could travel 5 meters without using gasoline, batteries, or any form of electrical energy. The vehicle also needed to carry a load equivalent to two rolls of pennies. I’ve always been curious about alternative energy systems, especially how cars could be powered by forces other than combustion or electricity. That curiosity made this project especially exciting—I wanted to build something clean, efficient, and completely powered by gravity. It pushed me to think critically about motion, friction, torque, and energy transfer. 
</p>

<h3>Design and Build Process</h3>

<p>
I started by sketching early schematics to map out how I might convert gravitational potential energy into forward motion. I considered solar panels, elastic bands, and magnets, but ultimately decided that a gravity-powered drop system would offer both mechanical clarity and room for iteration. The core idea was simple: lift a weight, attach it to the vehicle, and let it fall, converting potential energy into kinetic energy through a rotating axle system.
</p>

<p>
To test this concept, I mounted a vertical support structure made from lightweight wooden dowels. I tied a string to a heavy weight (a small dumbbell), ran the string through the support structure, and connected the other end to the rear axle of the car. As the weight dropped, it would unwind the string and spin the axle, propelling the car forward.
</p>

<p>
My first prototype did move forward, but it wasn’t reaching the required distance. After examining the results, I made a few key changes. First, I increased the diameter of the wheels. Smaller wheels needed too many revolutions to cover 5 meters, and larger wheels helped translate each turn of the axle into more forward distance. I used sturdy foam wheels and made sure the contact with the axle was secure to prevent slippage.
</p>

<p>
Next, I focused on increasing the energy available to the system. I raised the height of the vertical supports holding the weights, which increased the gravitational potential energy according to the equation <strong>PE = m × g × h</strong>. By doubling the height, I effectively doubled the energy available to spin the axle, since gravitational energy is directly proportional to height.
</p>

<p>
I also reduced friction by testing different axle materials. Initially, I used wooden dowels, but they created too much drag inside the chassis holes. I replaced them with metal rods and added straws as bushings to allow smoother rotation. This small change made a significant difference in reducing energy loss due to friction.
</p>

<p>
To ensure consistent traction, I wrapped the wheels in rubber bands, which gave them better grip on the testing surface. I also reinforced the frame with extra support so that the weight drop wouldn’t wobble the entire structure. Every tweak brought the car closer to the 5-meter mark.
</p>

<h3>Engineering Concepts and Lessons</h3>

<p>
This project gave me the opportunity to apply and test key concepts from mechanics. The gravitational potential energy stored in the elevated weight was converted into kinetic energy as the string unwound and rotated the axle. That rotational motion, in turn, created forward translational motion through the wheels.
</p>

<p>
I had to carefully balance the torque applied to the axle. If the axle diameter was too wide, the weight wouldn't provide enough torque to overcome static friction. If it was too narrow, the string would wind inefficiently, and the car would lose energy to internal resistance. I chose an axle diameter that offered a good compromise between torque and string control.
</p>

<p>
Another key lesson was understanding how friction plays both helpful and harmful roles. I needed friction between the wheels and the floor to generate motion, but too much friction in the axle or dragging components would waste energy. Every design change was driven by physical reasoning: more height meant more energy, more mass increased force but also added inertia, and better traction improved movement but required tuning.
</p>

<h3>Final Result and Reflection</h3>

<p>
After several rounds of testing and modification, my gravity-powered car was finally able to travel 5 meters consistently while carrying the full weight load. I was proud of the fact that I built a working system from scratch using basic materials and a solid understanding of mechanical energy. I learned how small changes in weight distribution, wheel size, or axle alignment can drastically affect performance.
</p>

<p>
More than anything, this project showed me how diffrent aspects of the design process contribute to sucess.Every successful modification required critical thinking, hands-on problem solving, and a clear understanding of how motion and energy interact. Watching the car finally roll across the finish line wasn’t just satisfying—it was proof that an idea on paper, when backed by physics and perseverance, can actually move.
</p>

<p>
It also reinforced something I’ve been interested in for a long time. I’ve always wondered how vehicles could work differently, how we could move people and objects using cleaner, simpler forces.
