<p>
This was my final project for AP Calculus. I wanted to explore something that felt personal while still pushing me to apply real math. I've been playing piano since I was little, and I've always been curious about how expressive moments in music—like a sudden swell in volume or a soft fade—could be measured or visualized. That curiosity led me to try something new: using calculus to analyze a recording of myself playing Brahms’ Intermezzo Op. 118 No. 2.
</p>

<p>
I recorded my performance using a Snowball microphone and imported the audio into editing software to generate a waveform. That waveform gave me a visual map of the music’s dynamics over time. I focused on a 10-second section between the 15 and 25 second mark, where the music shifts in volume and mood more dramatically. Zooming in on that stretch made it easier to work with the math and draw connections to the performance itself.

<h3>Applying Calculus to Sound</h3>

<p>
I treated the waveform like a graph of amplitude versus time, then used calculus to make sense of the patterns. At t = 3 seconds into that 10-second window, the first derivative hit 4215. That told me the volume was increasing at its fastest rate, which matched the moment in the music where the phrase suddenly crescendos. The amplitude peaked a second later at t = 4, reaching a local maximum of 3487.
</p>

<p>
I also looked at the second derivative to understand how quickly the change itself was happening. At t = 3, the second derivative was 4925, confirming a sharp acceleration in volume. Then, I used a Left Riemann Sum to estimate the total amplitude during that stretch. I got a value of 7291, which helped me think about dynamic intensity in a more concrete way. Each of these values lined up closely with markings in Brahms’ original score, like forte and ritardando.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
This project made me think about music in a completely different way. I've always played by feel, but seeing that those feelings could be mapped with slopes and curves was surprising. It reminded me that expressive moments in music aren’t just emotional—they have shape, motion, and structure too.
</p>

<p>
It also showed me that math doesn’t have to stay in a textbook. I used to see calculus as something abstract and far removed from creativity. But through this project, I realized it could help me understand something I already cared about deeply. That connection made the math feel more real.
</p>

<p>
Working on this reminded me why I enjoy both piano and problem solving. One lets me express emotion. The other helps me explore it more deeply. Together, they gave me a new way to see something familiar.
