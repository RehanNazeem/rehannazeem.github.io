This project was my final for AP Calculus. I wanted to go beyond textbook problems and apply calculus to something personal: music. I’ve been playing piano for 14 years, and I’ve always been drawn to how a performer controls dynamics — the rise and fall of volume, the shape of a phrase, the emotional pacing of a melody. But I’d never thought about those things mathematically before. For this project, I recorded myself performing the opening section of Brahms’ Intermezzo Op. 118 No. 2, a piece that’s rich with expressive detail. I used a Snowball microphone and waveform editing software to capture the exact shape of the sound and extract meaningful visual and numerical data from it.
</p>

<p>
The software generated a waveform — a graph of amplitude over time — that became the foundation of my calculus analysis. I isolated a 10-second interval (from 15 to 25 seconds into the performance) where the music went through the most dynamic transformation. This smaller window made the graph easier to read and allowed me to explore how musical expression shows up as mathematical change.
</p>

<h3>Calculus in Performance</h3>

<p>
From the waveform graph, I treated amplitude as a function of time, f(t), and analyzed its behavior. The sharpest change occurred at t = 3 (18 seconds into the performance), where the first derivative reached 4215 — a huge slope that matched a sudden crescendo in the music. At t = 4, the function reached a local maximum of 3487, representing the emotional climax of the phrase. These moments weren’t just musical — they were mathematically significant turning points.
</p>

<p>
I also calculated the second derivative at t = 3 and found it to be 4925, indicating a dramatic acceleration in sound energy. That told me not just that the volume was increasing, but that it was increasing quickly — the equivalent of musical momentum. Finally, I used a Left Riemann Sum to estimate the total amplitude over the interval. That value came out to 7291, which quantifies the “total expressive energy” packed into that segment. The math and the music aligned in a way that was surprisingly satisfying.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
This project changed how I understand both calculus and piano. Before, I thought of musical dynamics as an emotional instinct — a feel-based part of playing. But analyzing the waveform showed me that expressive playing actually follows real mathematical structure. A phrase that builds in intensity is a rising slope. A sudden drop-off is a shift in concavity. A powerful chord has a measurable spike in amplitude. These aren’t just artistic choices — they’re data points.
</p>

<p>
I also learned how versatile calculus can be. It’s not just for optimization problems or motion graphs. It’s a tool for interpreting real experiences, whether that’s the pitch of a rocket or the swell of a crescendo. Connecting music to math gave me a new appreciation for both. I still play by feel, but now I can also see what that feeling looks like on a graph.
</p>

<p>
It felt meaningful to apply something as technical as derivatives to something as personal as performance. This project helped me bridge two parts of my identity — the analytical and the expressive — and proved that creativity and logic aren’t opposites. They can work together.
