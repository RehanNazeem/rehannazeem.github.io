<h3>My Role</h3>

<p>
I currently serve as the President of FRC Team 2551: Penguin Empire, where I lead our team through every phase of the robotics season. From kickoff to competition, I coordinate build schedules, run design reviews, help guide mechanical decisions, and make sure everyone stays focused on our shared goals. Leading this team has taught me how to take initiative, adapt under pressure, and turn a group of ideas into a functioning robot.
</p>

<h3>Programming and Autonomy</h3>

<p>
One of my proudest contributions has been leading the programming subteam. I designed and wrote the core control system for our 2024 robot, including the autonomous routine. Our robot followed pre-planned paths using trajectory generation, feedforward tuning, and PID control. I also integrated vision-based targeting using PhotonVision, which allowed the robot to align precisely to field elements like AprilTags during autonomous mode.
</p>

<p>
I worked closely with the drive team and mechanical leads to test these systems on the field and make changes on the fly when we encountered real-world challenges. Every update to the code had to be tested under match conditions, which meant fast problem-solving and reliable communication with my teammates.
</p>

<h3>Hands-On with Electrical</h3>

<p>
While programming was my main focus, I also contributed to the electrical system. I wired motor controllers, configured CAN devices, and helped debug signal issues that came up during testing. I learned how to trace problems across subsystems, read diagrams quickly, and make repairs that would pass inspection. Understanding how sensors, motors, and power systems connect gave me a stronger sense of how software and hardware work together.
</p>

<h3>2023 World Championship</h3>

<p>
In 2023, our team qualified for the FIRST Robotics World Championship in Houston. Competing there was unforgettable. I helped troubleshoot autonomous code between matches, reviewed telemetry with the drive team, and worked with teams from around the world to develop on-the-fly strategies. Being part of an event like that pushed me to level up my skills and gave me a deeper appreciation for collaborative engineering.
