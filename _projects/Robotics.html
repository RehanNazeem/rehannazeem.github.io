<h3>Leadership and Role</h3>

<p>
I’m currently the President of FRC Team 2551: Penguin Empire, where I lead a team of over 30 students through the process of designing, building, programming, and competing with industrial-grade robots. As president, I don’t just handle logistics—I help set the creative and technical direction of the entire team. I manage timelines, run meetings, and ensure that our strategy, mechanical design, software, and electrical systems all align with the game objectives. It’s taught me how to motivate a team, how to problem-solve when things go wrong, and how to turn chaos into progress during crunch time.
</p>

<h3>Programming Leadership</h3>

<p>
Since sophomore year, I’ve led the programming subteam, where I’ve worked extensively on autonomous navigation, pathing, and real-time control systems. In the 2024 season, I designed and implemented a multi-stage autonomous routine that used trajectory following and closed-loop feedback with PID and feedforward constants. I tuned the robot’s drivetrain to follow smooth motion profiles while interacting with game elements, such as shooting objects into goals and navigating through tight field layouts.
</p>

<p>
One of the highlights of the 2024 bot was the use of vision processing with PhotonVision. I created pipelines that let the robot align to AprilTags and retroreflective targets using camera data in real time. I also configured latency compensation and filtering to keep the robot responsive, even under inconsistent lighting conditions. Integrating this with field-centric swerve drive required a strong understanding of math, geometry, and control theory, which I applied through practical debugging and testing.
</p>

<p>
All of our software was written in Java using WPILib, and I documented the code for other team members to understand and build upon. I also onboarded new programmers, ran code reviews, and coordinated closely with the mechanical team to make sure our code matched the physical build. We used GitHub for version control and maintained a modular architecture across subsystems.
</p>

<h3>Electrical Systems</h3>

<p>
In addition to programming, I helped with electrical integration throughout the season. I contributed to the design of our CAN bus layout, helped crimp connectors and power distribution boards, and debugged wiring issues that affected sensor data and motor controllers. I made sure all electrical systems were secure, labeled, and met competition inspection standards. 
</p>

<p>
I also worked on sensor alignment for encoders and limit switches, making sure that the software accurately reflected the robot’s physical state. It was a constant process of checking voltages, tracing signal flow, and sometimes rebuilding parts of the system in the middle of a match cycle.
</p>

<h3>2023 World Championship</h3>

<p>
In 2023, we qualified for the FIRST Robotics World Championship in Houston, where we competed against top-tier teams from around the world. It was one of the most intense and rewarding engineering experiences I’ve had. I helped optimize our autonomous routine between matches, debug code under time pressure, and worked with alliance partners to adapt strategies match by match.
</p>

<p>
Seeing thousands of students brought together by a shared love of engineering made it clear how much of an impact this community has. I came back even more inspired to keep pushing the limits of what our team can build and to mentor younger teammates so they could have the same opportunities.
