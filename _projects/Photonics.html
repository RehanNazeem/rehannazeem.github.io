As part of the Stanford SCi3 Mini Fellowship, I spent the summer studying photonics and sensor design in modern molecular imaging systems. The program gave me the opportunity to explore a research level topic, work with other students, and learn from mentors who helped guide us through challenging ideas. It was my first real exposure to how advanced physics and engineering connect to medicine, and it gave me a stronger understanding of both the science and the process of research.

<h2>Literature Review Focus</h2>

<p>
Photonics is the study and application of light. It covers how light is created, transmitted, detected, and manipulated. Everyday technologies like fiber optic cables and phone cameras depend on photonics. In medicine, it makes molecular imaging possible, which allows scientists and doctors to observe processes in the body at very small scales without surgery.
</p>

<p>
During the fellowship, I studied how different photonic tools improve molecular imaging. For example, near infrared fluorescence imaging uses light that penetrates tissue more effectively. Quantum dots can label molecules, and their emission depends on their size, which means multiple signals can be tracked at once. I also looked at sensor design, since devices like avalanche photodiodes and CMOS detectors affect how well an imaging system can detect weak signals, reduce noise, and create clear images in real time.

<h2>Seminars</h2>

<p>
While my main project focused on photonics, the fellowship also included seminars on broader scientific and engineering topics. These covered areas such as artificial intelligence in medicine, the physics behind medical imaging techniques, and discussions about how new technologies move from the lab into clinical practice. Hearing from researchers in these fields gave me a wider view of how different disciplines contribute to healthcare innovation, and it showed me how rapidly advancing fields like AI are beginning to intersect with physics based imaging approaches.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<p>
Molecular imaging is highly interdisciplinary. It combines physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering to create tools that can capture signals inside the body and turn them into useful information. Seeing how these fields work together was one of the most eye opening parts of the fellowship. It showed me that engineers are essential for turning discoveries into practical tools.

<p>
As an aspiring engineer, I approached the subject by thinking about design choices and their impact. When I studied sensors, I thought about how a tradeoff between sensitivity and speed might affect whether a doctor could see a tumor clearly during surgery. When I read about quantum dots, I thought about how materials engineering controls their size and emission. Looking at the field through an engineering lens helped me see not only the science but also the design challenges of making imaging systems reliable, affordable, and useful in real clinics.
