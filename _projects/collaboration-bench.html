<h3>Project Overview</h3>

<p>
For this project, I had two weeks to work with a team and create a full proposal for a new bench that could be installed at our school. We focused on designing a bench that encouraged comfort, conversation, and collaboration. We wanted it to feel natural for people to gather around, whether they were sitting casually, chatting with friends, or working together outdoors.
</p>

<p>
Our design ended up receiving the most first-place votes in our class and was also one of the top picks in the community. I believe people connected with how flexible and approachable the bench felt. It was not only a piece of furniture, but also a way to bring people together.
</p>

<h3>Build Process</h3>

<p>
The 3D model was the foundation of the entire project. I used SketchUp to create a digital version of the bench and made many of our design decisions based on what worked visually and structurally in the model. Once the shape and layout were finalized, I imported the file into Fusion 360 and refined it for 3D printing. The print took four hours and gave us a hands-on way to explain the design.
</p>

<p>
Blueprinting was the most difficult part. I started with rough sketches that were not to scale. After creating the digital model, I was able to draw the bench accurately from multiple angles. I highlighted fixing points and added extra notes so that someone could build the bench just by looking at the drawings.

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>
Although we created a slideshow to support the pitch, I didn’t want it to take over the presentation. Most of our focus was on the physical materials, like the 3D model and the blueprint. The slides helped show our location choice and gave structure to the pitch, but I often added more details as I spoke. That flexibility helped make the presentation feel more personal and genuine.
</p>

<h3>Design Thinking</h3>

<p>
Many parts of the design were based on how people already use space. I noticed students often sit in circular or angled formations on the ground during breaks. I wanted the bench to reflect that same shape but with more comfort. I also thought about how people communicate with and without phones, and how hard it can be to have full attention in a conversation. This bench was shaped to make conversations easier and more relaxed, without forcing face-to-face pressure.
</p>

<p>
We also considered sun exposure and selected a location where one side of the bench would stay shaded. Depending on the time of day and season, students could choose a warmer or cooler spot. I wanted the bench to adapt to real use, not just look good in one moment.
</p>

<p>
For the legs, I chose pressure-treated wood since they make direct contact with the ground. That choice made the bench more durable and better suited for outdoor use. Every piece of the bench was selected with long-term strength and function in mind.
</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
This project helped me connect design with the way people interact. I wasn’t only building something physical. I was building something that could shape how people relate to one another. Every step in the process, from modeling to blueprinting, helped me think about the connection between structure and human behavior.
</p>

<p>
It was also one of the most collaborative projects I’ve done. Everyone brought ideas, and we built something stronger because of it. I am proud of how carefully we planned every angle, joint, and seat, but I am even more proud of how the bench invites people to talk, sit, and spend time together.
